for iOS 4.2? untested!

this is just a quick sloppy implementation of the kernel part of
feedface (by @pod2g), used in iOS 4.2.1 for untethering...

to bootstrap this as an untether, the evasi0n amfi.dylib should
probably work.

$(SRCROOT)/hfs/exploit.hfs -> /private/var/jailbreak/exploit.hfs
$(OBJROOT)/kexploit        -> /private/var/jailbreak/hfs_untether
.. and so on
